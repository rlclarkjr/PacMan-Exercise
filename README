# PacMan Factory Exercise

My PacMen exercise where I changed the PacMan into a star.  You can create as many as you like and click start to have them bounce around the screen.

How To Run:  https://rlclarkjr.github.io/PacMan-Exercise/ in the browser window and then you can add stars and start the bouncing by clicking start button.
            They will bounce around the screen at different speeds and get faster if you keep clicking start button.
